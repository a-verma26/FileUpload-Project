# FileUpload-Project

The Aim of the project is to upload a file on a webserver and save the file in the Database. The Tech stack used are as below:
1) HTML(index.html)
2) CSS(style.css)
3) JavaScipt(script.js)
4) NodeJs(server.js)

HTML,CSS and JavaScript Code for Client Side Rendering. Node.js back-end code(Server Side Rendering) that saves the uploaded file to a database (MongoDB) using Mongoose.

In the above code, we first import the required modules (Express, Multer, and FS), then we set up the storage engine for Multer. After that, we use the upload.single method to handle a single file upload, and then perform any operation you want with the uploaded file. In this case, we simply log the file name and send the file back as a response.
